# DOOM

A directory of files for playing Doom.

This was one of the first games I played as a kid.  I was probably around 12 years old, and I used to play over modem w/ a friend from school.  I wanted to relive the memories.

On my computer this repo is full of WAD files, but they are so large I can't upload them to Github.

So, I will give you the links instead.  These are the mods I consider "the best".

## Files

The file structure here is to put the original game WAD files in ``IWAD``, and to put all the mods and custom campaigns in the ``PWAD`` folder, with nested subfolders for the IWAD they are built for.

- ``IWAD``
    - ``DOOM.WAD``
    - ``DOOM2.WAD``
    - ``TNT.WAD``

The trick here is knowing which mods you can stack w/ other mods.  Basically, if I didn't put a note, you can stack that mod with others.  Map mods should not be stacked w/ other map mods.

## Launcher

Be sure to checkout my shell script [DOOM Launcher](https://github.com/whipowill/sh-doom-launcher) which uses this directory structure to manage your mods and launch your games.
